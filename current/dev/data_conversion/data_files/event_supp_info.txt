I except that students taking this course do not presently posses mastery of the knowledge and skills covered in this course, which is why they take it. By encountering that with which we are unfamiliar and lack mastery, we learn.  The cognitive dissonance resulting from such encounters produces learning and growth.  Expect mastery of research design and interpretation as a result of the course, not as a prerequisite.||10/28/2007||

51916|event_desc|The week-long intensive will provide teachers with an introduction to arts integration- what it looks like and how it works  along with an in-depth exploration into the elements of music and drama and ways that they can enhance how a student learns to read.   Dr. Rosalind Flynns focus is on Curriculum-Based Readers Theater. Readers Theater is a rehearsed group presentation of a script that is read aloud rather than memorized. Teachers will learn how to plan, write, rehearse, stage and assess scripts with their students. Current research shows that repeatedly reading and rehearsing scripts based on curriculum content increases the likelihood that students will practice fluent reading, retain information and perform better on tests.  Marcia Daft teaches how integrating musical concepts (rhythm, best, meter, repetition) into the reading curriculum is effective in teaching word relationships, metric poetry and fluid and expressive reading.  Throughout the week, in small groups, everyone will develop lesson plans and present them to the entire group on the final day. Several opportunities will be provided for participants to observe the teaching artists demonstrating the arts integrated activities on a group of real students!   Recommendation: Bring several teachers from your school to make the experience more fun and encourage deeper understanding and learning.|438|10/28/2007||

52096|event_desc|Traditional conflict resolution is about helping both sides compromise a little, so they can meet in the middle.  But having had to compromise is usually the exact source of their conflict.  Resolving the conflict can not be your direct goal because, many times, it will up the feeling and fear of future compromise.  To resolve a conflict each side needs a safe place to make peace with their losses before, during and after the conflict.  Without the safety to grieve your losses any new compromise feels like a further loss.  A new perceived loss will reinforce potential further conflict.  A big part of being able to resolve your losses is the safety to feel and see how ineffective and useless conflict is.  It also help you see that the biggest loss in loss is not the loss, but the defended reaction in how it was handled.  A premature resolution to a conflict will increase the very conflict the resolution is trying to reduce.  Emotional or physical war is not about the illusion of gain in your conflict, but about the reality of loss in your life.|438|10/28/2007|469|06/21/2006

52153|event_desc|Traditional conflict resolution is about helping both sides compromise a little, so they can meet in the middle.  But having had to compromise is usually the exact source of their conflict.  Resolving the conflict can not be your direct goal because, many times, it will up the feeling and fear of future compromise.  To resolve a conflict each side needs a safe place to make peace with their losses before, during and after the conflict.  Without the safety to grieve your losses any new compromise feels like a further loss.  A new perceived loss will reinforce potential further conflict.  A big part of being able to resolve your losses is the safety to feel and see how ineffective and useless conflict is.  It also help you see that the biggest loss in loss is not the loss, but the defended reaction in how it was handled.  A premature resolution to a conflict will increase the very conflict the resolution is trying to reduce.  Emotional or physical war is not about the illusion of gain in your conflict, but about the reality of loss in your life.|438|10/28/2007|469|06/21/2006

52670|event_desc|Reiki (pronounced ray key) is one of the most ancient forms of healing known to man.  Reiki means universal life energy.  Rei describes the universal boundless aspect of this energy, whi ki is in itself part of Rei being the vital life force energy which flows through all living things.  Thus ki, is named chi by the Chinese, Holy Ghost by the Christians, Prana by the Hindus, Mana by the Kahunas and bioplasmic energy by the Russian researchers.  Reiki is an effective way of transferring this vital life energy.  Many scientists reach the point in their work where there is only one explanation left, namely that a superior intelligent force does exist:  a universal spirit which is continually creating the universe out of itself.  The latest in the Quantum physics came very close to this idea.  Reiki I is to open these natural energy channels in our hands and the hand positions on the body to enable the student to transfer this energy.  Reiki II is to strengthen the energy, to quiet your mind and to send this energy.  Reiki III is to turn up the power, a fourth symbol and the ability to teach.  All symbols can be seen and read about in books, however an initiation from a teacher of Reiki who has taken their Masters training is required to transfer this energy.   |438|10/28/2007|2558|12/18/2006

Ford boils down the search for meaning to the bare essentials, showing the difference between viewing the world from a religious point of view and that of a naturalist, and comparing a scientific worldview to a philosophical one. Ford investigates the contributions of the Greeks, Kant, and William James, and brings the discussion up to date with contemporary thinkers. The answers provided by traditional religions to increasingly difficult questions have lost their currency for many.  But the reductive or rationalist answers provided by science and postmodernism are themselves rife with unexamined assumption.                     |3089|12/06/2007|3267|08/07/2008

54219|event_desc|Welcome to what I hope will be an enjoyable exploration of theatre and performance. Those of you who have an interest in, or experience with, live theatre will find that approximately 50% of this course will be dedicated to the study of that particular topic. That is as it should be, I believe, because the long and colorful history and traditions of theatre date back approximately 2500 years to the Golden Age of Greece, and still form the basis for most discussions within the larger context of performance.  For the purposes of this class, performance simply refers to a variety of activities that do not fall under the traditional heading of theatre. These might include music and dance performances, stand up comedy, film, cartoons, the circus, teacher/student interactions,  political performance, and many others too numerous to mention here. As we progress through this class, your own personal ideas about performance will be a valuable asset to our discussions. There is no absolute, all-encompassing definition of performance. The term is controversial and highly contested both in and out of academia. As an introductory level course, we will not spend a lot of time on performance theory (That subject is covered in Comt 350). Instead, we will read and/or view a wide variety of performances and talk about them. YOUR TEXTBOOK IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENRICHING YOUR PERSONAL BACKGROUND ON PERFORMANCE. THERE ARE NO TESTS IN THIS CLASS. Apart from suggested readings from your text, any additional classroom materials will be provided by the instructor.  |438|03/07/2008|438|09/03/2008

55217|event_desc|Mornings: This workshop is designed to use place value as a tool to understand the four basic arithmetic operations. Using a monetary approach and calling numbers by their correct place value names, the participants will find many creative and humorous ways to teach the basic math concepts. Developmental theory, multiple intelligences and different learning styles will be emphasized which should enable teachers to help all students, including those who are dyslexic and math anxious, to understand math concepts from the concrete stages to the abstract. The final outcome of the workshop is to understand that arithmetic is answering the question whereas mathematics is questioning the answer.  Afternoons: Everything we know about geometry , mathematics, and all spatial arrangement and organization of matter is demonstrated by cutting into the wholeness of the sphere. When we cut the sphere we have pieces, parts, and fragments. It is no longer whole. When keeping the wholeness of the sphere and compressing it to a flat plane nothing is lost, all the spatial information is compressed into a flat circle disc.      |438|04/02/2009|438|08/19/2009

55373|event_desc|The concept of Gracious Space was developed through the Center for Ethical Leadership (www.ethicalleadership.org) and is being used by organizations and groups all over the country.  The concept is to create a safe atmosphere that contributes to relationship building.  By creating a shared vision for your group it is more likely to be productive and foster healthy and strong relationships.  Members learn to work together cooperatively despite differences in their age, gender, race or ethnicity.  All ideas are valued.  Gracious Space is not conversation or debate in the absence of conflict or tension; participants learn ways to work through difficult and challenging conversations through mutual respect.  The concept has been used successfully in many arenas including health care, government, community, non-profit groups and schools.  Practitioners of this philosophy find they are less judgmental, better listeners and more able to be open.  The result is an increase in productivity, creativity, and the opportunity for new understandings of others.  |335|04/30/2009|438|11/13/2009

55438|event_desc|We will explore the  FOLLOWING ISSUES that THREATEN  our kids everyday:   Bullying in schools is a worldwide problem that  can have serious negative consequences for the  general school climate and for the right of students  to learn in a safe environment without fear.  Bullying can also have negative lifelong  consequences--both for students who bully and for  their victims.   Cyberbullying is when a child, preteen or teen is  tormented, threatened, harassed, humiliated,  embarrassed or otherwise targeted by another  child, preteen or teen using the Internet,  interactive and digital technologies or mobile  phones.   If you google Teen Cybersex you will find  2,160,000 sites.   When gangs exist in a community, they can  seriously impact schools, using them as  recruitment centers and claiming them as gang  territory. A report issued by the U.S. Departments  of Education and Justice found that the percentage  of students reporting gangs at school nearly tripled  between 2001 & 2005. This report also found a  strong correlation between the presence of gangs  and both guns and drugs on school campuses   Suicide is the third leading cause of death in  individuals between the ages of 10 & 19 in the  United States.  ese are serious topics none of us want to admit  could happen in our schools, our community, or  our families. But they do. Join us for this two  day event to explore how we can work together as  educators, parents, and professionals to be  informed, learn prevention methods and most  importantly how to talk to our kids about these  issues so that we can create Safe Schools and a  Safe Community for them to grow up in.|438|05/21/2009|438|11/23/2009

55616|event_desc|The concept of Gracious Space was developed through the Center for Ethical Leadership (www.ethicalleadership.org) and is being used by organizations and groups all over the country.  The concept is to create a safe atmosphere that contributes to relationship building.  By creating a shared vision for your group it is more likely to be productive and foster healthy and strong relationships.  Members learn to work together cooperatively despite differences in their age, gender, race or ethnicity.  All ideas are valued.  Gracious Space is not conversation or debate in the absence of conflict or tension; participants learn ways to work through difficult and challenging conversations through mutual respect.  The concept has been used successfully in many arenas including health care, government, community, non-profit groups and schools.  Practitioners of this philosophy find they are less judgmental, better listeners and more able to be open.  The result is an increase in productivity, creativity, and the opportunity for new understandings of others.  |438|09/14/2009|438|11/02/2009
